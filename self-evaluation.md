# Self Evaluation Questions:

- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? 
*I feel very confident with the basics of Arrays right now. However, I was looking through the Ruby Docs and had difficulty choosing a new array method that I understood...so there's more productive struggle ahead, I'm sure!*

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*I know I could practice better explaining in technical language the lines of code. The examples in our lessons are VERY helpful, it's just difficult to remember in one day. I'll be focusing on this in my paired session.*

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
*Hmmm, I suppose one question would be how arrays fit into an if statements.*
